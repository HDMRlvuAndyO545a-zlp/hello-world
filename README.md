THis is a test, I have no idea what I'm doing

<style>
  .balls {
    border-radius: 50%;
    position: fixed;  
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    top: 60%;
    animation-name: jump;
    animation-duration: 2s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  }
  @keyframes jump {
    50% {
      top: 10%;
    }
  </style>
  
  The magic of copying and pasting. Probably doesn't work here though.
